MDPreview
=========

MDPreview is a Markdown previewer for the GNOME desktop writting using PyGTK and GtkMozEmbed. It is a very short Python script but a very handy aid specially for people hacking on stuff from sites like GitHub and using Linux on the desktop.

Installation
============

In Ubuntu you can install MDPreview like this:

    apt-get install python-gtk2 python-gtkmozembed

Then, simply copy mdpreview.py to /usr/bin/mdpreview:

    sudo cp src/mdpreview.py /usr/bin/mdpreview

Using MDPreview
===============

From the command line simple call mdpreview with the name or full path to the Markdown file you want to preview like this:

    $ mdpreview README.md

Using Nautilus (GNOME's file manager) you can right-click on a file and choose to open it with MDPreview. Just browse to the location of the mdpreview script or enter /usr/bin/mdpreview as a custom command.

Ideas, patches and bug reports are welcomed. Please file an issue.
